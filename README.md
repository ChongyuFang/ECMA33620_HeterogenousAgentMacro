## ECMA 33620 Heterogeneous Agent Macroeconomics
Spring 2022, The University of Chicago\
Prof. Greg Kaplan

This is the repository of my MATLAB codes for simulation tasks in the problem sets. Problem sets questions are also provided.

This course is an intro to macroeconomics with heterogeneous households. Topics include consumption-savings problems, income dynamics, wealth inequality in partial and general equilibrium, and the effects of fiscal and monetary policy in the presence of household inequality.

### Problem Set 1
Deterministic finite horizon consumption-savings problem with indivisible labor supply using **Value Function Iteration (VFI)**.

### Problem Set 2
Stochastic infinite horizon consumption-savings problem with Markov-transition income processes, government taxes, and household lump-sum transfers using **Euler Equation Iteration (EEI)** and **Endogenous Grid Point (EGP) Methods**.

### Problem Set 3
Stochastic infinite horizon consumption-savings problem in **Aiyagari model** setting with stationary Recursive Competitive Equilibrium (RCE) using **Euler Equation Iteration (EEI)**.
